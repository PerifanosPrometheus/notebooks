Experiment Summary . Let $(G_1, G_2) sim rho-SBM( vec{n},B)$. (NB: binary, symmetric, hollow.) . $K = 3$. . the marginal SBM is conditional on block sizes $ vec{n}=[n_1,n_2,n_3]$. . $B = [(.20,.01,.01);(.01,.10,.01);(.01,.01,.20)]$. (NB: rank($B$)=3 with evalues $ approx [0.212,0.190,0.098]$.) . with $n = 150$ and $ vec{n}=[n_1,n_2,n_3] = [50,50,50]$ . for each $ rho in {0,0.1, cdots,0.9,1.0 }$ generate $r$ replicates $(G_1, G_2)$. . For all $r$ replicates, run $GM$ and $GM_{SS}$ each $t$ times, with each $t$ corresponding to a different random permutation on $G_2$. . Specifically,$G_2&#39; = Q G_2 Q^T,$ where $Q$ is sampled uniformly from the set of $n x n$ permutations matrices. . For each $t$ permutation, run $GM$ &amp; $GM_{SS}$ from the barycenter. . For each $r$, the $t$ permutation with the highest associated objective function value will have it&#39;s match ratio recorded . For any $ rho$ value, have $ delta$ denote the average match ratio over the $r$ realizations . Plot $x= rho$ vs $y$= $ delta$ $ pm$ 2s.e. . This notebook contains figures for $r=50$, $t=20$ . Description of $GM_{ss}$ Procedure . For each $r$, ASE each graph into $d=3$ yielding $Xhat_1$ &amp; $Xhat_2$ . MedianFlip both into the first orthant yielding $Xhathat_1$ &amp; $Xhathat_2$ . let $Phat = Xhathat_1 Xhathat_2^T$ and run $t$ repititions of gm with $G_1,G_2 and Phat$ as the similarity. . sns.set_context(&#39;talk&#39;) #sns.set(rc={&#39;figure.figsize&#39;:(15,10)}) plt.errorbar(rhos,average_ss, error_ss,marker=&#39;o&#39;,capsize=3, elinewidth=1, markeredgewidth=1, label=&#39;GM+SS&#39;) plt.errorbar(rhos,average, error,marker=&#39;o&#39;,capsize=3, elinewidth=1, markeredgewidth=1, label=&#39;GM&#39;, color=&#39;red&#39;) plt.xlabel(&quot;rho&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;avergae match ratio&quot;) plt.legend() plt.savefig(&#39;GM_GM+SS.png&#39;,fmt=&quot;png&quot;, dpi=150, facecolor=&quot;w&quot;, bbox_inches=&quot;tight&quot;, pad_inches=0.3) . &lt;ipython-input-111-9d9e37bc5d45&gt;:8: MatplotlibDeprecationWarning: savefig() got unexpected keyword argument &#34;fmt&#34; which is no longer supported as of 3.3 and will become an error two minor releases later plt.savefig(&#39;GM_GM+SS.png&#39;,fmt=&#34;png&#34;, dpi=150, facecolor=&#34;w&#34;, bbox_inches=&#34;tight&#34;, pad_inches=0.3) . diff = ratios_ss[9,:] - ratios[9,:] plt.hist(diff, bins=20) plt.ylabel(&#39;Density&#39;) plt.xlabel(&#39;Match Ratio Difference (GM+SS - GM)&#39;) plt.title(&#39;Paired Difference Histogram (Rho = 0.9)&#39;) .

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . #collapse-hide import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . #collapse-show cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive. Example charts taken from this repo, specifically this notebook. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
